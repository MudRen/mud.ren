Sooner or later you will want to get rid of an object. The efun you use
is <CODE>destruct()</CODE>. However, the gamedriver <EM>only</EM> allows the
object that issued the <CODE>destruct()</CODE> efun to actually be
removed. This means that every object need to have a function that you
can call from another object in order to be able to destroy it from
without. If the object doesn't contain the <CODE>destruct()</CODE> efun, it
will remain for the duration of the game.
</P><P>

Well, actually there exists a backdoor that allows you to destroy any
object, but it's a command you have to issue manually. You can't use it in
a program.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX63"></A>
However, the standard object base - which is being discussed in more
detail later - does define a function called <CODE>remove_object()</CODE> that
you can call to destroy the object. Since all objects actually in the
game <STRONG>MUST</STRONG> inherit the standard object you can rely on having
that function there. It's possible to mask it, thereby blocking that
function. However, masking <CODE>remove_object()</CODE> is tantamount to
sabotage so please don't even think about it. The reason the function is
maskable is so that you should be able to add last-second cleanup code,
not so that you should be able to render the object indestructible.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>void remove_object()
e.g.
    void
    remove_balrog(string bal_name)
    {
        object bal;

        bal = find_living(bal_name);
        if (objectp(bal))
            bal-&#62;remove_object();
    }
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If you use the <CODE>destruct()</CODE> efun directly or call
<CODE>remove_object()</CODE> in the object itself, make <STRONG>DOUBLE</STRONG> sure
that no code is being executed afterwards. You see, execution isn't
aborted on completion of the destruction, the object is just ear-marked
as <EM>destructed</EM>, actual removal is done when execution of it is
finished. This means that function calls or commands issued after
destruction might give rise to runtime errors in other objects.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>void destruct()
e.g.
    void
    destruct_me()
    {
        write("Goodbye, cruel world!\n");
        destruct();
    }
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

When an object is destructed, <EM>ALL</EM> object pointers (not string
references) in the game pointing at the destructed object are set to
0. Due to this fact it's usually sensible to make sure that an old
object reference still is valid before doing anything with it. You never
know, it just might have been removed since you obtained it.
</P><P>

if an object contains other objects in its inventory when it is
destructed, those objects will be destructed with it. The exception is
interactive objects, players. If you update a room you are effectively
destructing it, if it has players in it they will be moved to their
respective starting locations. If the room <EM>is</EM> the start location
or if there is a problem with moving them (buggy start location or
impossible to move them) those players will be destructed as well. In any
circumstances you should always be able to rely on an object being
destructed when ordered to. 
</P><P>

The one time there's problems with this is when the function
<CODE>remove_object()</CODE> has been overridden and has a bug in it. That
might just abort the process and cause problems.
