<H3> 2.2.2 Inheriting object classes </H3>
<!--docid::SEC57::-->
<P>

Assume that you want to code an item like a door, for example. Doing
that means that you have to create functionality that allows the opening
and closing of a passage between two rooms. Perhaps you want to be able
to lock and unlock the door, and perhaps you want the door to be
transparent. All of this must be taken care of in your
code. Furthermore, you have to copy the same code and make small
variations in description and use <EM>every time</EM> you want to make a
new door.
</P><P>

After a while you'll get rather tired of this, particularly as you'll find
that other wizards has created doors of their own that work almost - but
not quite - the same way your does, rendering nifty objects and features
useless anywhere but in your domain. 
</P><P>

The object oriented way of thinking is that instead of doing things over
and over you create a basic door object that can do all the things you want
any door to be able to do. Then you just inherit this generic door into a 
specialized door object where you configure exactly what <EM>it</EM> should
be able to do from the list of available options in the <EM>parent</EM> door.
</P><P>

It is even possible to inherit several different objects where you can
combine the functionality of several objects into one. However, be aware
that if the objects you inherit define functions with the same names, they
will indeed clash. Just be aware of what you are doing and why, and you
won't have any problems.
</P><P>

The syntax for inheriting objects is very simple. In the top of the file
you write this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>inherit "&#60;file path&#62;";
e.g.
	inherit "/std/door";
	inherit "/std/room.c";
</pre></td></tr></table>	
<STRONG>NB!</STRONG> This is <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> a preprocessor command, it is a statement,
so it does <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> have a <CODE>#</CODE> in front of it, and it is ended
with a <CODE>;</CODE>. As you see you may specify that it's a c-file if you
wish, but that's not necessary.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
The <EM>child</EM> will inherit all functions and all variables that are declared
in such a way as to permit inheriting. If you have a function with the same
name as a function in the parent, your function will <EM>mask</EM> the parent
one. When the function is called by an external call, your function will be
executed. Internal calls in the parent will still go to the parent function.
Often you need to call the parent function anyway from the child, you do 
that by adding <CODE>::</CODE> to the internal function call.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>void
my_func()
{
    /* 
     * This function exists in the parent, and I need to
     * call it from here.
     */
    ::my_func();        // Call my_func() in the parent.
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

It is not possible to call a masked function in the parent by an
external call, it is only available from within the object itself.
</P><P>

You can even add up more than one <CODE>::</CODE> instruction on top of
another to reach higher levels. Each <CODE>::</CODE> only means 'back up one
inheritance step, and look for the function there. If it's not there,
look further up'. So, <CODE>::::::func()</CODE> simply means 'back up three
inheritance steps and look for <CODE>func()</CODE> there, if not found, look
even further up until you find it'.
</P><P>

If you have managed to confuse matters by having a function with the
same name as an efun, the compiler needs a bit of help in knowing which
function you actually mean. Now, it isn't exactly the brightest thing
you can do to put yourself in this situation, but you will even find
examples of it in the mudlib (in <CODE>/std/player/savevars_sec.c</CODE> to be
specific, and I even *cough* seem to remember that it was I who wrote
that part once upon a time), so I guess even the sun has spots... 
Anyway, to solve the problem, simply precede any such efun call with the
instruction <CODE>efun::</CODE>, and the compiler will know what you mean.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>void
deep_inventory(object ob)
{
    write("Dumping inventory of object '" + file_name(ob) + "'");
    dump_array(efun::deep_inventory(ob)); /* Call to real efun */
}

int
my_fun(string arg)
{
    object ob;

    if (objectp((ob = find_object(arg))))
        deep_inventory(ob);    /* Call to local version above */
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>
