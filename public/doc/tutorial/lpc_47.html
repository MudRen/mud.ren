<H3> 1.3.1 The #include statement </H3>
<!--docid::SEC47::-->
<P>

This is by far the most used preprocessor command. It simply tells the
preprocessor to replace that line with the contents of an <EM>entire</EM>
other file before going any further.
</P><P>

Data you put in <EM>include-files</EM> is usually data that won't ever
change and that you want to put into several files. Instead of having to
write those same lines over and over with the cumulative chance of
putting in copying errors as you go, you simply collect that data into
one or more files and include them into the program files as necessary.
</P><P>

The syntax is very easy:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#include &#60;standard_file&#62;
#include "special_file"
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<STRONG>NB!</STRONG> Note the absence of a <CODE>;</CODE> after the line!
</P><P>

The two different ways you write this depend on where the file you want to
include exists. There's a number of standard include files in the game,
spread around in a number of different directories. Rather than having to
remember exactly where they are, you can just give the name of the file you
want to include then.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#include &#60;stdproperties.h&#62;
#include &#60;adverbs.h&#62;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If you want to include files that aren't part of the standard setup, for
example files of your own, you have to specify where they are. You do that
either relative to the position of the file that uses it or by an absolute
path.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#include "/d/Genesis/login/login.h"
#include "my_defs.h"
#include "/sys/adverbs.h"	// Same as the shorter one above
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

When you include standard files, <EM>always</EM> use the &#60;&#62;-path
notation. The reason isn't only that it becomes shorter and easier to
distinguish but also that if the files move around your program will stop
working. If you use the &#60;&#62;-notation they will always be found anyway.
</P><P>

Include files can have any name, but as a rule they are given the '.h'
suffix to clearly distinguish them as include files.
</P><P>

It is even possible to include <CODE>c</CODE>-files, i.e. to include entire
files full of code. However, doing that is <CODE>very</CODE> bad form. Do
<EM>not</EM> do that <STRONG>EVER</STRONG>! Why? Well, since you include the
uncompiled code into several different objects, you will waste memory and
CPU since these identical included parts has to be compiled and stored
separately for each object that uses them. Apart from all this just
reading the code will be a chore better not even contemplated.
</P><P>

What has the extension of the file name <EM>really</EM> to do with the
contents then? Well...  actually nothing at all. However, the convention
is to keep code, functions that are to be executed, in <CODE>c</CODE>-files
and definitions in <CODE>h</CODE>-files. Usually the mudlib reflects on this
convention and might not recognize anything but <CODE>c</CODE>-files as code
sources.
