<H3> 2.3.4 Alarms: Asynchronous function execution </H3>
<!--docid::SEC83::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX75"></A>
Sometimes it's desirable to postpone execution of code a while and
sometimes you want things to happen regularly. The gamedriver counts
something called <EM>evaluation cost</EM>, or <EM>eval cost</EM>. It's simply
a way of measuring the amount of CPU cost an object uses. Any given
object is only allowed a certain amount of eval cost per execution
chain. When that amount is used up, the object aborts. How the eval cost
is computed isn't very important, it's set so that the game shouldn't be
held up too long. However, the existence of eval cost makes a bit of
special programming necessary. When you have very heavy computations you
need to do, they simply won't fit within the maximum allowed eval cost,
so you need to cut the job up in chunks and do it bit by bit.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
All of this adds up to a need for a function that allows you to do
things regularly, or with delays. The alarm functionality will do this
for you. The efun <CODE>set_alarm()</CODE> will allow you to create a delayed
alarm, possibly repeating, that will call a given function as you
decide.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>int set_alarm(float delay, float repeat, function alarm_func)
remove_alarm(int alarm_id)
mixed get_alarm(int alarm_id)
mixed get_all_alarms()
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX77"></A>

<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
The function returns a unique alarm number for that alarm and that
object that you can use later to manipulate the specific alarm. You can
retrieve info for the alarm with the efun <CODE>get_alarm()</CODE>, remove it
with <CODE>remove_alarm()</CODE> or even get info about all alarms in an
object with the efun <CODE>get_all_alarms()</CODE>. The latter function is
mostly used when you either haven't bothered to save the alarm ids, or
when you want to display info about the object. The efun
<CODE>set_alarm()</CODE> allows you both to define a delay until the function
is called the first time, and a delay between repetitive calls. Every
alarm call will start with an eval cost at 0. 
</P><P>

<STRONG>NB!</STRONG> A word of caution here... Since the function gets called
asynchronously in respect to a user of the object, both
<CODE>this_player()</CODE> and <CODE>this_interactive()</CODE> might return
undefined values. Sometimes 0, sometimes the object you expect,
sometimes another value. So, don't rely on what they return, instead
stick the object you want to use in a variable <EM>before</EM> starting
the sequence and use that. Remember this since some efuns rely on a
defined <CODE>this_player()</CODE> value. A lot of tricky bugs has been
traced back to this particular problem in the past, so beware!
</P><P>

<STRONG>IMPORTANT! READ THIS CAREFULLY!</STRONG>
</P><P>

It's very easy to fall to the temptation to split a heavy job into
several alarm calls with fast repetition rates. However, this is
<STRONG>NOT</STRONG> the intended use for this efun. A deadly sin is to have an
alarm function that generates repeating alarms within a repeating
alarm. The amount of alarms will then grow exponentially and the
<STRONG>ENTIRE GAME</STRONG> will stop almost immediately. This is so incredibly
stupid as to be a demoting offense, so make sure you do things
<STRONG>RIGHT</STRONG> the first time. In general, delays between repeating
alarms should be greater than one second, preferably two, as well as
delays to single alarms.
</P><P>

The alarm functions will be demonstrated more extensively in chapter three.
