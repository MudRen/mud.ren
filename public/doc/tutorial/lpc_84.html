<H3> 2.3.5 The inventory and the environment </H3>
<!--docid::SEC84::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX80"></A>
<A NAME="IDX81"></A>
As described earlier, an object defines an <EM>inside</EM> as well as an
<EM>outside</EM>. The outside, or <EM>environment</EM> can only be one object, while
the inside, or <EM>inventory</EM>, can contain many objects.
</P><P>

A newly cloned object ends up in a sort of limbo, without an
environment. In order for an object to actually enter the simulated
physical world of the game it has to be moved there. However, not all
objects can be moved around. In order for the game to work <STRONG>ANY</STRONG>
object that wants to be inserted somewhere or have objects inserted into
it <STRONG>MUST</STRONG> inherit `<TT>/std/object.c</TT>' somewhere along the way in
the inheritance chain. Why this limitation?  Well, the reason is that
the standard object defines a number of handy functions we rely on all
objects in the game to define.
</P><P>

The most important of these lfuns are:
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX82"></A>
<A NAME="IDX83"></A>
<A NAME="IDX84"></A>
<A NAME="IDX85"></A>
<A NAME="IDX86"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>`<SAMP>move()</SAMP>'
<DD>Move an object to another object and handle weight/volume
accounting. Returns success code. This function is responsible for
calling the following:
<P>

<DT>`<SAMP>enter_inv()</SAMP>'
<DD>This function is called in an object when another object moves inside
it.
<P>

<DT>`<SAMP>leave_inv()</SAMP>'
<DD>This function is called in an object when another object moves out from
it.
<P>

<DT>`<SAMP>enter_env()</SAMP>'
<DD>This function is called in an object upon entering the environment of
another object.
<P>

<DT>`<SAMP>leave_env()</SAMP>'
<DD>This function is called in an object upon leaving the environment of
another object.
</DL>
<P>

<STRONG>NB!</STRONG> The above <STRONG>ONLY</STRONG> works if you use the lfun
<CODE>move()</CODE> in the object to move them around. That's why it's so
important that you do it this way and not by the efun that actually
performs the move.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX87"></A>
The efun used in the <CODE>move()</CODE> lfun is
<CODE>move_object()</CODE>. <STRONG>BUT</STRONG>, remember when doing that none of the
object internals like light, weight or volume is updated. As previously
stated the efun fails if the object you want to move, or move to,
doesn't inherit `<TT>/std/object.c</TT>'. Furthermore the efun can only be used
from within the object that wants to move, it can't be used to move
another object. The same goes for the <CODE>move()</CODE> lfun, naturally.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX88"></A>
In order to get the enclosing object reference you use the efun
<CODE>environment()</CODE>. As I have said before all objects have no environment
on creation, it's only after they have been moved somewhere that it gets
a proper environment. Once an object has been moved into another object
it can't be moved out into limbo again, i.e. you can't move it to '0'.
The objects in the game you can expect not to have an environment are
either rooms, souls, shadows or daemon objects of one kind or another.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX89"></A>
<A NAME="IDX90"></A>
You have two efuns to chose between when it comes to finding what's in
the inventory of an object. The efun <CODE>all_inventory()</CODE> returns an
array with all the objects in the inventory of a specified object, while
the efun <CODE>deep_inventory()</CODE> return an array with all objects
recursively found in the inventory, i.e. not only the objects you'll find
immediately but also the objects <EM>in</EM> the objects in the inventory,
and so on.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>object *all_inventory(object ob)
object *deep_inventory(object ob)
e.g.
/*
 * This function dumps the inventory of Fatty on the screen,
 * either just what's immediately visible or all depending
 * on a given flag.
 */
void
fatty_say_aaah(int all)
{
    object fatty_ob, *oblist;

    if (!objectp((fatty_ob = find_player("fatty"))))
    {
        write("Sorry, Fatty isn't in the game today.\n");
        return 0;
    }

    oblist = all ? deep_inventory(fatty_ob) : all_inventory(fatty_ob);

    write("The " + (all ? "entire " : "") + 
                " content of Fatty's bloated tummy:\n");
    dump_array(oblist);
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

So... how do you go about to determine if a specific object actually is
present in the inventory of another object? Well, the base object 
<CODE>/std/object.c</CODE> define both names and descriptions in objects, as
described before. It also defines a special function called <CODE>id()</CODE>
that, given a name, checks all given names to an object for a match and
returns 1 if the object has that name. The efun <CODE>present()</CODE> takes
a name or object reference and searches one or more object's inventories
for the presence of the named or specified object. If you specify the
object to search for as a name string it will use the previously mentioned
<CODE>id()</CODE> function to determine if the object is the right one or not
for all objects it examines. The execution of the function is aborted as
soon as it finds one that fits the description. That means that if there
are several objects fitting the search pattern you will only get one of
them.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>object present(object ob|string obref, object *oblist|object ob|void)
e.g.
/*
 * Look for donuts in Fatty
 */
void
find_donut()
{
    object fatty_ob;

    fatty_ob = find_player("fatty");

    // Can't find Fatty!
    if (!objectp(fatty_ob))
    {
        write("Fatty isn't in at the moment, please try later.\n");
        return;
    }
       
    if (present("donut", fatty_ob))
        write("Yes, Fatty looks happy with life at present");
    else
        write("If I were you, I'd keep out of Fatty's " +
                  "reach until he's fed.\n");
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If you don't give any second argument to <CODE>present</CODE>, it will look
for the specified object in the inventory of <CODE>this_object()</CODE>, i.e.
the object itself. If the second argument is given as an array, the
function will look for the specified object in all of the objects in the
array. If no fitting object is found, 0 is returned.
