<H3> 1.1.5 Object makeup </H3>
<!--docid::SEC15::-->
<P>

An object is comprised of something called <EM>functions</EM> and
<EM>variables</EM>. A function is a set of instructions you can reference
by a name. A variable is a kind of container you can store data in for
use by the functions. Some functions are already defined by the
gamedriver, they are called <EM>external functions</EM>, or
<EM>efuns</EM>. Functions defined in LPC code are called <EM>local functions</EM>,
or <EM>lfuns</EM>. To confuse matters further there is a set of functions that
count as efuns, but are written in LPC. These functions are called
<EM>simulated efuns</EM> or <EM>sfuns</EM>.
</P><P>

An efun basically is a function that is impossible to create in LPC.
Take for example the function <CODE>write()</CODE> that allows you to present
text on the screen of a player. It's impossible to make that up from
other functions in LPC, so it has to be in the gamedriver. This efun is
available in <EM>all</EM> LPC programs. Efuns also have no idea about what
environment they are used in. They don't care one bit if they are used
to simulate strawberry tasting, or as part of a game.
</P><P>

A function like <CODE>add_exit()</CODE> on the other hand, that adds an exit
in a room is only available in room type objects. It is written in LPC.
The lfuns as a rule are part of the makeup of the environment in which
the objects are used. The example <CODE>add_exit()</CODE> for instance is well
aware of such ideas as directions and travel costs, a very limited and
specific concept.
</P><P>

The function <CODE>creator()</CODE> is a good example of the third case. It's
a function that is available in every object, it returns information
about who created a certain object. This information is <EM>very</EM>
specific to the environment since it deals with such notions as code
localization. This kind of function is easy to write in LPC but on the
other hand it must be available in all objects, as if it was an
efun. Due to this fact the special object `<TT>/secure/simul_efun.c</TT>' is
made to be automatically available from all other objects in the game,
you'll find all sfuns in there. This functionality is perfectly
transparent to you; you just use them as you use any other efun and you
don't have to be aware of that it really is an sfun.
