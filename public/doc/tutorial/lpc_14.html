<P>

An <EM>object</EM> in LPC is simply a copy of an existing and loaded
program in computer memory. When a program is loaded into memory to
produce a <EM>master object</EM>, the code is compiled to produce the
instruction list described earlier and a chunk of memory is associated
to it as specified by the program code for use for internal <EM>global
variables</EM> (described later). When a copy, a <EM>clone</EM> of this program
is made, a special reference called an <EM>object pointer</EM> is
created. That pointer is given a reference to the master code
instruction list and a unique chunk of memory. If you clone the object
another time, a new pointer is created and a new chunk of memory
allocated. When an object is destroyed its associated memory is freed
for use by other objects, but the instruction list is kept untouched. An
object is <STRONG>always</STRONG> cloned from the master object. If you want to
change the program you must <EM>update</EM> the master object to instruct
the gamedriver that a new list of instructions is to be compiled from
the source code.
</P><P>

However, any already existing clones will not change just because the
master does. They will keep their reference to the old instruction
list. It's important that you remember this so that you don't believe that
the behaviour of an old cloned object changes just because you have updated
the master object. As you see it's possible to have clones of objects in
the game that behave differently, simply because they are made out of
different source codes, just cloned between updates and changes in
code. This could be a great source of confusion, so keep it in mind.
